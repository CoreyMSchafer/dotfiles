### When to Use Web Search vs Context7

You have access to both web search and Context7. Use them strategically:

**Use web search for:**

- Modern best practices and industry standards
- Comparing different approaches or frameworks
- Understanding what professionals use in the real world
- Community consensus on tool choices
- Blog posts, tutorials, and real-world usage patterns
- Broader context and comparative analysis

**Use Context7 for:**

- Official documentation and API references
- Recommended learning paths from library maintainers
- Current syntax for specific libraries/frameworks
- Version-specific features and methods
- Verifying what's actually available in the latest releases
- Exact method signatures and parameters

**General approach:** Start with web search to understand the landscape and best practices, then use Context7 to verify specifics from official docs.
