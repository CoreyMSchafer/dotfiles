# Copilot Project Instructions

- IMPORTANT: Any time you use a library/framework, use context7 for documentation/APIs. If the target version isn't specified, use the pinned version in pyproject.toml; otherwise, use the latest stable version. In your answer, confirm the version you decided to use.
- Avoid deprecated APIs (check docs/changelogs via Context7). If Context7 isn’t available, say so.
- Optimize for correctness over speed; briefly state assumptions and ask clarifying questions if needed.
- Keep edits consistent with the repo’s style; use **Ruff** for formatting/linting as configured.
